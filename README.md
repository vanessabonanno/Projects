## Projects Repository

This repository contains the main projects I accomplished during the master degree Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge (University of Bologna), the bachelor degree Multimedia Sciences and Technologies (University of Udine) and during free time.

In this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F163_fWAeI9M5qhkJsGS_75GMAlwMEKW?usp=sharing) you can find some other bachelor's and master's degree-related files of projects I made, as well as part of my bachelor's degree thesis on Per un Amico. At the link, you will also find "Music" folder which contains my personal musical projects and part of Carvel Cakes rock band concert in which I played guitar, bass, MIDI keyboard and sang lead vocals.
