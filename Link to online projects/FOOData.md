FOOData was created for the Open Access and Digital Ethics exam by Vanessa Bonanno, Giorgia Sampò, and Sarah Tew. FOOData explores food production, pollution, and health markers within Europe both individually and together to get a clearer picture of their interlation. FOOData uses geospatial visualizations to reconnect users with the geographic reality of food production and pollution.
