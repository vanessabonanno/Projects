Feel your rhythm prototype (short video) was created as part of the final project for "Digital Heritage and Museology", Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge course at the University of Bologna.

It aims at explaining explain the functioning of a hypothetical multimedia application that involves one or two users in an augmented reality experience to discover and learn the rhythm of Shakespearean, Petrarchan and other sonnets.
The design idea could be implemented inside Casa del Petrarca, Arquà Petrarca, to renovate this museum reality.
