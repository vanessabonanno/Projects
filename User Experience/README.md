This is the final project "Different twins" for the course User Experience of DHDK, University of Bologna.
The main aim of the project is to use the interface to trasmit two separate (and complementary) messages at the same time.
«Different twins is the design of a web site / web application / mobile app / desktop application meant to allow an organization, company, or community to deliver two different, complementary messages from the same interface.»

In this case it is about the redesign of the [VAAY](https://vaay.com/en/) website.
